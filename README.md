## Platform  
---
- macOS, Linux, windows

## Dependency

```
- and you can get the result image image.ppm
## Feature

A simple raytracer from scratch, starting from a output of a pure color image, I built a simple vector computation library, defined classes for ray, hittable objects, materials(lambertian, dielectric, metal), etc.
